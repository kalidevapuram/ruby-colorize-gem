How does your gem take advantage of Rubyâ€™s metaprogramming capabilities?
Meta programming gives the ability to reopen a inbuilt class or module and modify the objects default behavior which makes an advantage to create ruby gem. Use of meta programming while creating gem reduces the code repetition. 


How long did you spend working on this project?
I spent almost 5 to 6 hours to get the project successfully complete.


What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
The main challenging part while creating a colorizr gem is, how to print the calling object in a method. Which it took a lot of time to complete. Without any base coding for the project it takes more time to understand the project.


Where do you still have room to grow?
I still have to learn some meta programming concepts, and have to do some more projects on meta programming to understand clearly.
